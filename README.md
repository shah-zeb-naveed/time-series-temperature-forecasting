Time Series Forecasting of Temperature using SARIMA

A project on SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive, Integrated, Moving Average) model that forecasts temperature. This notebook includes some notes from Intel Time Series Analysis training and the textbook Business Statistics in Practice. In this notebook, I build several SARIMA/ARIMA models and compare their forecast errors. The main methodology followed is according to the Box and Jenkin's methods.
